Multihop cellular networks (MCNs) incorporate wireless ad hoc networking into traditional single-hop cellular networks (SCNs) and thus they enjoy the flexibility of ad hoc networks, while preserving the benefit of using infrastructure of SCNs. In this Thesis, we study the resource allocation problems in MCNs.
